    "# Notebook 02: Denoising with DADA2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to take our raw, paired-end FASTQ files and process them using the DADA2 pipeline. This will correct sequencing errors, merge our paired reads (R1 & R2), and remove chimeras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output will be our two most important files for downstream analysis:\n",
    "1.  **Feature Table (`table.qza`):** A matrix of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) by samples (i.e., the counts).\n",
    "2.  **Representative Sequences (`rep-seqs.qza`):** The unique DNA sequence for each ASV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1.  **Create a Manifest File:** We need to create a \"map\" (`manifest.csv`) that tells QIIME 2 where to find the R1 and R2 files for each sample.\n",
    "2.  **Import Data:** We will use the manifest file to import our 255 samples into a single QIIME 2 artifact (`.qza` file).\n",
    "3.  **Run DADA2:** We will run `qiime dada2 denoise-paired` using the truncation parameters we found in Notebook 01 (`--p-trunc-len-f 160` and `--p-trunc-len-r 160`).\n",
    "4.  **Analyze DADA2 Stats:** We will inspect the summary statistics from DADA2 to see how many reads we successfully filtered, denoised, merged, and non-chimeric."
